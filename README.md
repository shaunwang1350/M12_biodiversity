### Summary
Used Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create a web interactive data visualization. It includes a completed panel for demographic information that visualizes bacterial data in 1700+ volunteers' belly button. It also allows for the identification of the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons, completeddwith a dashboard that displays volunteers hygiene level.


### Objectives
* Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
* Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
* Parse data in JSON format.
* Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
* Use JavaScript’s Math library to manipulate numbers.
* Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
* How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
* Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.
* Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP to select only the most populous species.
* Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
* Complete the demographic information panel.
