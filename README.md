# M12_biodiversity

### Background
Roza has a partially completed dashboard, but she needs to finish it. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

### Objectives
* Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
* Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
* Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.

### Procedure
